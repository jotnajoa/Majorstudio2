I found two books related to my thesis project.
My thesis project is about how vocabularies are used in hip hop songs from the beggining of the hip hop genre (Sugarhill gang - rapper's delight, 1979) upto today's hip hop songs.

I would like to focus on basically three parts as below.

    1.How the use of vocabulary has changed over the last 40 years 
      ex) does it become less diverse? if so how less diverse?
    
    2.If there are some trend each decade in terms of words, what is the 
      'representing' word in each decade?

    3.How many vocabularies a listener need to know to fully understand 
      hip hop songs if the listener is a foreigner

The references would be some books focusing on liguistic aspect of hip hop songs and the methodology of composing lyrics / meanings.
